            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IGnorance of the Divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty of Heaven, and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt here below, are the chief Supporters of Faction and Schiſm; Ignorance being the Mother of a blind Zeal, and
<pb facs="tcp:101094:3"/>Intereſt the Guide of a Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natical Conſcience. To inform the one, I have expos'd my ſelf to publick Cenſure: To unmask the other, I have compil'd theſe following Meditations. Such as they are take them: If thou art offended, it ſhall not in the leaſt diſſatisfie me. It is a Doctrine I will maintain, <hi>Though I mingle my Blood with my Sacrifice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The <hi>Loyal</hi> are exempted from cenſure, if any gaul'd Beaſt is touch'd, I ſhall only laugh to ſee him wince.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:101094:3"/>
            <p>I know well enough how ſome Perſons will reſent this, and I fear it will rather diſturb their unſettled Spirits, then work in them the leaſt amendment. If I labor in vain, it is no more than what the beſt of men have done before me: <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> and all the Prophets were ſent to a <hi>ſtiff-necked</hi> and <hi>diſobedient</hi> Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. Men of rare accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and indefatigable indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry, have ſpent their whole time, and yet perhaps have not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail'd with one refractory Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. I do not expect to ſpeed better than they, the Subject of
<pb facs="tcp:101094:4"/>my Diſcourſe being unpleaſing to many, and what is ſtill worſe, we ſeldom read of a Rebel that ever had the Grace to Repent.</p>

            <p>I Read of a certain time when there was no King in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but every man did that which was right in his own eyes. Four times I find this mentioned in Scripture; and in this Anarchy, ſo great was the peoples Impiety, that we can hardly, except amongſt our ſelves, find its parallel. <hi>Micha</hi> turns Idolater, the <hi>Danites</hi> Robbers, and the Men of <hi>Gibeah</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a Rape upon the <hi>Levites</hi> Concubine: So was our caſe, when every <hi>Sniveling Phanatick</hi> proclaimed his own Humour, ſet up the Calf of his own Brain, and danc'd about it. The
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:101094:5"/>Army diſhoneſtly rob'd and plunder'd all that durſt be honeſt; every Miniſter is eſpouſed to his ſeveral Congregation, God Almighty is the Father which gives them in this myſtical Marriage; and when (with the <hi>Levite</hi> before mentioned) they have with much pains and patience, long-ſuffering and meekneſs, travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to reclaim their Errours, and call them back to their firſt Loves; muſt they by the <hi>Benjamites,</hi> thoſe ravening Wolves, which love to devour the prey, and divide the ſpoil, as their Father <hi>Jacob</hi> had propheſied of them, <hi>Gen.</hi> 49.27. Muſt they, I ſay, by their Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtrations, raviſh them from thence. This was done when there was no King in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when every mans Sword was his own Carver, and every ones Affections ſat Judge of his own Actions; we had then, to our grief, no King but thouſands of Tyrants. But God, who is a God of Order, pittying our Diſtractions, out of this Chaos of Confuſion commanded Light and Life, giving us the Breath of our Noſtrils, the Light of our Eyes, even our moſt Gracious Sovereign, the Anointed of the Lord. This was the hand of God, this is his own Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; and whoſoever preſumes to oppoſe it,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:101094:5"/>
               <hi>Contra animatam dei imaginem, pugnat,</hi> rebells againſt the walking repreſentative of Omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency: <hi>Inde Imperator, unde &amp; homo,</hi> the ſame hand which made him Man, crown'd him King; and this the Apoſtle teſtifieth, when he ſaith, <hi>there is no power but of God;</hi> this conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration forc'd in St. <hi>Bernard</hi> ſo brave a Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, that maugre the Confederacy of the World, he would prove himſelf a Chriſtian to God, by a Loyal Subjection to his Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, <hi>Si totus orbis</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>adverſum me conjuraret,</hi> &amp;c. ſhould the whole World con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire againſt me, to compel me to act any thing againſt my King, I would fear God and his ordinance, and therefore durſt not offend. Religious Soul, he would be no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious Covenanter, no aſſociating Traitor; and he gives his Reaſon, <hi>Non enim ignoro ubi legerim, Qui Poteſtati reſiſtit: Whoſoever reſiſteth the Power, reſiſteth the Ordinance of God, and they that reſiſt, ſhall receive to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Damnation.</hi> In which words we have three things to be conſidered; firſt, that So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veraign Power is an Ordinance of God. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, Becauſe it is ſo, it ought not to be reſiſted. Thirdly, The Puniſhment of them
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:101094:6"/>who preſume to reſiſt; of each in order. To the firſt, that Soveraign Power is an Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God. When the pleaſure of God had called the People of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to be his own peculiar Inheritance, he did not preſently, and at the firſt, eſtabliſh one perpetual Form of Government, or ſet the imperial Crown upon the Head of his anointed; but uſhers in the Royalty of a King, with ſome inferior Subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination of Power; from Captains he gave them Judges, then Prophets, then Judges again, as if Almighty God contriv'd a way how beſt, and upon the beſt experience, he might be a ſafe-guard to his People. But when theſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Titles, could not prevail againſt the daring Out-rages, and bold Preſumptions of the Tribes, Then did he exalt his Throne, creates his Vice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roy, and diſcovers his King upon his holy Hill of <hi>Sion.</hi> Here God ſtops, he proceeds no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, no change from hence. St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> proves Monarchy, for this cauſe, to be the beſt Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, becauſe it was the laſt which God eſtabliſh'd. When the deeds of darkneſs durſt ſee the light, and owl-ey'd Iniquity dar'd approach the Sun when the high hand of Impiety diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd the co-ercive Power of their inferior
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:101094:6"/>Magiſtrates, God raiſed up a new Succeſſion of Princes, a race of Kings to ſuppreſs thoſe Inſolencies. Hence St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſtiles them the Miniſters of God, his Revengers to execute wrath upon them which do evil. In Kings, ſaith <hi>Lactantius,</hi> there is a double appearance, they are men before God, but Gods before men. Their Commiſſion is ſigned in Heaven, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.15. <hi>By me Kings Reign:</hi> Their Authority is confer'd by Heaven: They are the Anointed of the Lord: Their Power deſcends from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 21.1. <hi>The King ſhall rejoyce in thy ſtrength, O Lord;</hi> and from hence we muſt of neceſſity conclude, that Soveraign Power is the Ordinance of God. But further to confirm this, let us look upon the great Pattern of our Lives, and Saviour of our Souls, when he who is the Judge of Heaven and Earth, ſtood be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Judgment Seat of <hi>Caeſar</hi> to be adjudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; he confeſſes himſelf to be the Author of that Power which ſpoke his Condemnation. I cannot here omit the Obſervation of St. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin,</hi> that at the Creation where God brought forth all other Creatures in abundance, ſtoring all the Earth with many <hi>Individuums</hi> and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars of the ſame Species; as many Beaſts,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:101094:7"/>many Birds, and the like: he made but one man, and determined all the reſt ſhould flow from his Loins, and ſo acknowledge him their Chief, and Principle: and ſo from him a lineal Deſcent ſhould be derived by primogeniture, in whoſe hands ſhould reſt the Government of all the reſt. So that we ſee Monarchic Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is by God's own order the moſt na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural. When men began to multiply upon the face of the Earth, and became as the Stars of Heaven, or as the Sand upon the Sea-ſhore for multitude; for the better peace and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility of the World, and the free courſe and Adminiſtration of Juſtice, God's Providence was pleaſed to elect ſome particular Perſons to govern the ſeveral Provinces and Dominions of the Earth. He ſuffered not all the great men in any place to have an equal ſhare in Authority and Power; leaſt that <hi>Ariſtocracy</hi> ſhould have bred Emulation, which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly the Parent of Diſcord; he was much further from letting all the People enjoy a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, leſt their Democracy ſhould have brought in Confuſion. But he exalts the horne of his anointed, he diſpoſes the reſt in ſubordinate Offices under him, thereby maintaining ſo
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:101094:7"/>bleſſed a Conſort here below, as that it is an imperfect ſhadow of that bleſſed Harmony which is above. And upon theſe Perſons thus exalted, God hath beſtowed an eſpecial Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter to ſecure them from any dangerous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracies: <hi>Touch not mine anointed,</hi> ſaith <hi>David, Chron.</hi> 1.16. my <hi>Meſſias,</hi> ſaith the Original, as if the Brow of Majeſty were the neareſt Draught, and livelieſt repreſentation of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God. Hence it is that they were hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oured in the pureſt times by the beſt of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, with ſuch Appellations as did befit their greatneſs; their words, <hi>Divalis juſſio,</hi> the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dible Voice of God, their preſence, <hi>Sacra ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtigia,</hi> the cleareſt foot-ſteps of the Deity. This Primitive Doctrine would ſtill be believed and practiſed, were it not for ſome who creep in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Pulpits, as cuſtomary Birds, at the time of the year, into hollow Trees; where out of a zealous ignorance they dare declaim againſt all Authority as Anti-chriſtian, all Antiquity as Heretical, all moral Learning as in it ſelf Damnable; which I muſt confeſs is the beſt Plea for their own ignorance. Theſe are <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roboam</hi>'s Calves ſet up at <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel,</hi> to hinder People from going up to the Houſe of
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:101094:8"/>the Lord, where the true Expoſition of the Law would teach them their Duty. It is the Apoſtle's advice to his Son, <hi>Titus</hi> 3.1. <hi>Put them in mind to be ſubject to Principalities and Powers, and to obey Magiſtrates;</hi> for indeed all Authority deſcends from God, and our Supe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors bear the Image of the Divine Power. There is no ſin in the World which God hath puniſhed with ſo great Severity and high De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation, as that of Rebellion. For the ſin of Idolatry, and other Crimes, God hath ſent the Sword, the Peſtilence, and the Famine; but it was never heard that the Earth opened, and ſwallowed up any, but only Rebels againſt their Prince: <hi>Quibus dum non eſſent digni vivere</hi> (ſaith <hi>Optatus) nec mori conceſſum eſt,</hi> not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving to live, they were not vouchſafed to dye. <hi>Sepulti ſunt priuſquam mortui,</hi> they which had made a Separation from their Fathers, were not ſuffered to be gathered to their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers but go down quick to Hell. To what hath been ſaid, I ſhall only add the conſent of the Primitive Church, and the Teſtimony of the ancient Fathers; and by that I hope I ſhall clearly prove my firſt Propoſition, <hi>viz.</hi> that Soveraign Power is an Ordinance of God.
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:101094:8"/>In the days of old before Religion was adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terated, as <hi>Euſebius</hi> tells us, the Reverend Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in the Primitive times were wont to bleſs the patience of their Chriſtian Souldiers; bleſs them for their Loyalty; bleſs them for their Service which they performed to their moſt cruel Blood-ſucking Perſecutors, when they behaved themſelves like the ſtouteſt Champi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the Cauſes of their Emperors, under whom they were more likely to ſuffer Death, than to receive a Reward; they were encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged with an <hi>Euge, ſic decet Chriſtianos;</hi> well done, now ye ſhew that ye ſerve the Lord of Heaven, by obeying his Vice-Roys, his own Ordinance here on Earth. When our Saviour Aſcended into Heaven, he left the holy Spirit as a Legacy to his Church, to guide it into all Truth. I hope St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> were true, and ſound Divines. And we find both theſe affirming that Soveraign Power is of God. But we are faln into the dregs of time, wherein we have ſome who through ignorance and impudence dare aſſert, that had theſe Apoſtles lived in theſe times, when Chriſtians knew their own ſtrength, they would have taught the Church another Doctrine. Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:101094:9"/>Wretches! can they not be content to wreſt the Scripture to their own Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but muſt they lye againſt the holy Ghoſt; and make the holy Spirit of God, in whom there is no ſhadow or ſhew of turning, to be byaſs'd by intereſt, and to ſerve the times? Never <hi>Muſſel-man</hi> yet thought ſo of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> or Heathen, of the courſe of Nature. If we conſider the Writings of the Heathens, we ſhall find that they attribute more to their Princes, than many profeſſing Chriſtianity are willing to acknowledge: <hi>Plutarch</hi> tells us, <hi>Principes ſunt Miniſtri Dei, &amp; à Deo conſtituti.</hi> Tacitus <hi>Minime ambigendum eſt imperium à Deo habere Principes!</hi> Princes are the Miniſters of God, and are conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted by him, ſaith the one; and it is not to be doubted, but that they receive their Power from God, ſaith the other. St. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> is ſtill more clear, <hi>Lib.</hi> 5. <hi>De Civ. Dei Cap.</hi> 25. <hi>Non tribuamus dandi Regni atque imperii poteſtatem niſi Deo vero,</hi> which the Apoſtle may interpret for us; the Powers which are ordain'd of God; St. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> tells us, <hi>Cujus juſſu naſcuntur homines, hujus juſſu &amp; Reges conſtituuntur;</hi> he that ſaith unto them Live, gives them Power likewiſe to Reign. To what purpoſe ſhould I add more,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:101094:9"/>but only that by which St. <hi>Peter</hi> characterizes the Separatiſts of his time, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.10. which may not unfitly be applied to ours; <hi>they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe Government, Preſumptuous are they, Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will'd, and are not afraid to ſpeak evil of Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities.</hi> I know not whether I may call St. <hi>Jude</hi>'s Epiſtle a Hiſtory of thoſe times, or a Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of theſe; he tells us of men <hi>crept in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>awares, who ſeparate themſelves, diſſatisfied, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring Perſons, and diſobedient.</hi> But I paſs to the ſecond.</p>
            <p>Secondly, We ought not to reſiſt: I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume none preſent will be ſo impious as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny but that the Sacred Scripture is the Rule, both of our Faith, and our Obedience. The Apoſtle adviſes, that we ſhould deſire the ſincere Milk of the Word, that we may grow there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by. But alas, ſome Perſons have rub'd over theſe Breaſts of our dear Mother the Church with Gall and Wormwood. Should we follow their corrupt Expoſitions, they would make the Waters of the Sanctuary like thoſe of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi> where we may ſit down and weep when we remember <hi>Sion.</hi> They pretend to Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but in the mean time would trample Conſcience, Obedience, Religion and Duty,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:101094:10"/>both to God and Man under foot. The Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Biſhop <hi>Davenant</hi> in his twelfth determined Queſtion, tells us, <hi>Induant quam velint pietatis Larvam, iſti Magiſtratuum Reformatores, &amp;c.</hi> Let them mask under what Vizard they will, Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may be their Plea, but Rebellion is their Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice. There is no pretence whatſoever ſhould make us Rebel. We ſhould not only ſerve the <hi>Veſpaſians,</hi> who are the love and delight of Mankind, but we ſhould take the advice of the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.13. <hi>To ſubmit our ſelves to every Ordinance of man, for the Lords ſake;</hi> and he liv'd in the time of <hi>Tiberius</hi> and <hi>Nero,</hi> who were ſtiled <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> heaps of Morter tempered with Blood. Take the Sweet-Singer of <hi>Iſrael</hi> for your Pattern, and I chiefly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound him, becauſe he is honoured with the glorious Character of being a man after God's own heart; ſee the Hiſtory, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 26. When <hi>Saul</hi>'s guilty Conſcience gave him leave to fleep in the Trenches of <hi>Hachilah,</hi> with his men of War about him; we ſhall find as many Arguments to arm <hi>David</hi>'s hand againſt him, as ever met to depoſe a Sovereign Title.</p>
            <p>Firſt, on <hi>Saul</hi>'s part, He was an unnatural Tyrant againſt his own Son <hi>Jonathan;</hi> He was
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:101094:10"/>a bloody Perſecutor of the Prieſts of God, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding them to be ſlain, becauſe their hands had been with <hi>David.</hi> He was a ſacrilegious Uſurper of the holy Offices. He was a demo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niacal furious Man, poſſeſs'd with a Devil.</p>
            <p>Next, on <hi>David</hi>'s part, His Life was ſought for, and by ſparing <hi>Saul,</hi> in all humane pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability he deſtroyed himſelf. He had all the opportunity that Night and Security could adminiſter unto him. He was a Succeſſor to the Kingdom by the Prophets Unction; and yet for all this, as if he had been a Champion to maintain the right of Princes, he ſtops <hi>Abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſha</hi>'s hand with a <hi>Quis unquam, who can lift up his hand againſt the Lords Anointed and be guiltleſs.</hi> The <hi>Helvetian</hi> Divines have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared an <hi>Anathema</hi> againſt all thoſe who ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther openly by offence, or privately pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing defence, ſhall oppoſe their Magiſtrates. There is a <hi>Damnamus</hi> paſs'd upon them, the Churches Sentence is pronounced, and they will find Heaven as inflexible as their rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Hearts.</p>
            <p>I am amazed when I behold the pureſt time of our Religious Fore-Fathers, and ſee thoſe bleſſed Martyrs, even when they were dreſs'd
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:101094:11"/>up in Flames, and accompanied <hi>Elijah</hi> to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in a fiery Chariot; when they were grind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing between the Teeth of Lyons, and were dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven up to the tops of Mountains, as ſo many Sheep to the Slaughter; when their ingenious Torturers were overcome at their own Art; and could invent no Puniſhment equal to their Patience; even then at their hour of Suffering, to hear them Pray for their Perſecutors; to hear them poure out their Souls in their moſt pious Devotions, for a Bleſſing on the Heads of thoſe Tyrants under whom they ſuffered; and we, who enjoy all thoſe Bleſſings which a peaceable Government can in rich a Land with, which ſit every man under his own Vine, and under his own Fig-tree, partaking of our own Labours, and the fatneſs of the Earth; that we, who are at reſt on every ſide, when the reſt of the Chriſtian World is imbrued in Blood; that we, I ſay, ſhould not be content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and yield all faithful and thankful Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to God's Vice-gerent.</p>
            <p>I cannot but wonder, when I hear mention of the Loyalty of ſome <hi>Heathens;</hi> ſome of them expoſing their Bodies to the deadly ſtroke of their Enemies, to ſecure the Perſons of their
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:101094:11"/>Emperors; others leaping alive into their Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Piles, as if they could do them no later, no greater Service. Are we Chriſtians? Are we Proteſtants? What think we then of that Branch of the Proteſtation, that we will maintain the eſtabliſh'd Doctrine of the Church, as it ſtands in oppoſition to Popery, and Popiſh Innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions?</p>
            <p>This Poſition of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> will ſhew us part of the Doctrine of the Church of <hi>Rome: Non licere Chriſtianis tolerare Regem Haereticum;</hi> Princes falling into Apoſtacy from the Faith, or Hereſie in the Faith, looſe all Dominion over their Subjects. How much worſe than theſe were ſome amongſt us, who under a pretence of Religion, commit a Rape upon Right, and deſtroy the Faith's Defender?</p>
            <p>I dare oppoſe this 13. of the <hi>Romans,</hi> againſt the Power of Men or Devils, that would trample upon the necks of Kings: <hi>Let every Soul be ſubject,</hi> v. 1. mark the ſtyle; There's a Statute Law enacted in the High Parliament in Heaven, which no man which owes a Soul may Break, without High-Treaſon againſt man, and higher Impiety againſt God. The moſt Refractory will have a ſpecious Pretence;
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:101094:12"/>they make it a matter of Conſcience, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil transforms himſelf into an Angel of light, but they make no Conſcience to diſobey. Their Plea for Rebellion, is the ſame by which the Apoſtle ſhews the neceſſity of Obedience, <hi>v.</hi> 5. <hi>Ye muſt needs be ſubject, not only for wrath, but alſo for Conſcience-ſake.</hi> To this let me add that Precept of the Reverend Biſhop <hi>Taylor,</hi> The Law of God commands us, therefore we muſt make a Conſcience of keeping the juſt Laws of our Superiors; and although the matter before the making of the Law, was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, yet now the Obedience is not indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent. And again, Lift not up thy hand a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thy Prince, upon what pretence ſoever; but bear all Perſonal Affronts and Inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies at his hand, and ſeek no Remedy, but by Patience and Piety.</p>
            <p>The moſt Reverend Biſhop <hi>Cranmer,</hi> in the days of King <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth, in his Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the Fifth Commandment, tells us, that by it we are bound not to withdraw our Feal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, Truth, Love and Obedience from our Prince, for what cauſe ſoever it be; nor yet for any cauſe may we conſpire againſt his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, nor do any thing towards the hinderance
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:101094:12"/>or hurt thereof, or of his Eſtate. The Pious Biſhop <hi>Latimer</hi> tells us, that we may, for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the World, Rebel againſt the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God, that is, the Magiſtrate. Theſe glorious Saints and holy Martyrs, did in their actions confirm their Doctrine, and in the days of Queen <hi>Mary</hi> received the triumphant Crown, obeying her in ſuffering for that which their Conſciences would not give them leave, actually to perform.</p>
            <p>After them comes that painful and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rend Biſhop <hi>Jewel,</hi> diſputing with <hi>Harding,</hi> iſſues in the Story of <hi>Chilperick</hi> King of <hi>France.</hi> His Nobles depoſed him, the Commons were convented, and the Pope confirmed it, Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion as well ſtrengthned as heart could wiſh; yet his Succeſſor <hi>Pipin,</hi> ſcarce ever, with quiet, enjoyed the Kingdom, and of nine Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which were all of that Race that ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded, hardly one was found which went down to his Grave in Peace.</p>
            <p>Theſe are men, whoſe very names will tell you that they have been applauded for their Piety, ſhould we blot out theſe from the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue of the Church, I fear we ſhould have but a poor Charter for our Religion.</p>
            <pb n="18" facs="tcp:101094:13"/>
            <p>If then there be any here, with whom that Sacred name of <hi>Majeſty,</hi> like a high Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain at a great diſtance, hath ſeem'd to vaniſh into the Air, and ſeem'd a little nothing, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appear'd; ſuffer your ſelves to be undeceived. Search the Scriptures; if you be of the Faith of your Fore-Fathers, have the ſame Conſcience. <hi>David</hi> did privily cut off the skirt of <hi>Saul</hi>'s Garment, <hi>But his heart ſmote him,</hi> and he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver found Peace in himſelf, till his tears had waſh'd out his faults. But we do not oppoſe the King, ſaith the <hi>Phanatick, the King is a good King, a merciful King!</hi> (and ſo he is in ſpight of their ſaucy bold-fac'd Decraction.) But yet there is ſomething which troubles them, they are griev'd that he is not leſs a King, or that they are not more his Maſters. If he be ſo good, (which nothing but impudence will preſume to queſtion) why do they then not yield obedience. The Reaſon is clear, a Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Spirit can never be long content with any Government. How careful were the Loyal <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> to preſerve the Royal Perſon of their Prince, when they exempted <hi>David</hi> from the danger of a War? a War commenc'd by an annatural Son! and manag'd by the advice of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:101094:13"/>an ungrateful Traytor, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 18.3. <hi>The Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſaid, thou ſhalt not go forth, for if we flee away, they will not care for us, neither if half of us dye, will they care for us. But now thou art worth ten thouſand of us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again, as if the whole Kingdom, at his Death, were to have been intombed in a fatal and diſconſolate Grave of darkneſs, or elſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned to a perpetual night, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 21.17. <hi>The men of</hi> David <hi>Sware unto him ſaying, Thou ſhalt go no more out with us to Battel, that thou quench not the light of</hi> Iſrael.</p>
            <p>Are ye Chriſtians? or hath ſome new born title taken away that name? If you have not renounced your Baptiſm, but ſtill continue what you pretend to be; I know you'l find that Damnation is the Portion of them that reſiſt the Ordinance of God.</p>
            <p>And this brings me to the third and laſt thing, namely, the Puniſhment of them that reſiſt. They ſhall <hi>receive to themſelves Damnation. Rebellion,</hi> as the Scripture tells us, <hi>is as the Sin of Witchcraft;</hi> and commands likewiſe, <hi>That we ſhould not ſuffer a Witch to live:</hi> Theſe are left to the cenſure of the Magiſtrates, and to
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:101094:14"/>the Puniſhment due to them by the Laws. But as for incorrigible Rebels, God takes them to task himſelf; <hi>Pſalm</hi> 106.17, 18. <hi>The Earth opened and ſwallowed up</hi> Dathan, <hi>and covered the Congregation of</hi> Abiram, <hi>and a fire was kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled in their company, the flame burnt up the wicked.</hi> St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, that <hi>the wages of every unrepented ſin is death.</hi> But ſuch a hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid crime as this, <hi>Heats the Furnace ſeven times hotter than it was;</hi> it cauſes the Worm that never dieth, to gnaw more violently, and add new Stings to the <hi>eternal Scorpions.</hi> At the hour of ſuch a Perſons Death, when Deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration begins to knit up all with a direful ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſtrophy; the Pulſes beating ſlowly, the Head akeing violently, Body and Soul refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Comfort, he ſees the Devil ready to pay him the Wages of unrighteouſneſs, <hi>and he receives to himſelf Damnation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But the King ſhall rejoyce in thy ſtrength, O Lord, exceeding glad ſhall he be of thy Salvation; for thou haſt given him his hearts deſire, and haſt not denied him the requeſt of his Lips; thou ſhalt prevent him with the Bleſſing of goodneſs, and haſt ſet a Crown of pure Gold
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:101094:14"/>upon his Head. His Honor is great in thy Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; Glory and great Worſhip ſhalt thou lay upon him; for thou ſhalt give him everlaſting Felicity, and make him glad with the joy of thy Countenance.</hi>
            </p>
